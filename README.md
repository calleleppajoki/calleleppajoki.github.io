Portfolio site.

Longer term todo:
  - When needed, maybe fix domain
  - Github pages and SPA routing isn't "nice", and I used an ugly HACK. Should do better I suppose.
  - Mobile views, do it with the router solution
  - Improve on the logo, in css? Font, or something.
  - Static Blog Engine
  - Select fonts
  - Actual 404? Or is it better to just go to "home"
